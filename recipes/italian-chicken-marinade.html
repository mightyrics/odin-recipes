        <h2>This Italian dressing chicken marinade is a super simple but delicious way to add flavor before grilling.</h2>
        <p>This italian Chicken Marinade recipe makes me all nostalgic for my childhood. Once a week my mom would marinate chicken breast in store-bought Italian dressing for the family.</p>
        <p>I obviously had to recreate this meal with a homemade Italian chicken marinade that’s just as good…okay, better!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
