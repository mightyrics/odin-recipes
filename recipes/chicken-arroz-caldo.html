    <h1>Chicken Arroz Calo (Chicken Rice Porridge)</h1>

    <h2>Arroz caldo is a comforting and flavorsome Filipino rice and chicken soup served mainly as a snack but can be enjoyed any time of the day.</h2>
    <p>Chicken arroz caldo is a type of Filipino rice porridge with chicken slices. It is best served when topped with hard boiled eggs, some chopped scallions, and toasted or roasted garlic. I personally like to squeeze a piece of calamansi or lime over the toppings. It makes the dish taste fresher and delicious.</p>
    <p>This chicken arroz caldo version makes use of glutinous rice (or malagkit). It is the variety of rice that is frequently used to make rice cakes or kakanin such as biko and suman. The previous arroz caldo recipe that I shared is almost the same, except that it asks for regular white rice such as Jasmine.</p>
    <p>I find it nice to add kasubha to chicken arroz caldo to give it a yellowish color. However, this ingredient does not influence the taste of the dish. If you want your arroz caldo to have a yellowish color while tasting even better, add Spanish saffron instead. I tried it several times and it always works like a charm.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 ¼ pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce (Optional)</li>
        <li>5 ¼ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lemon, sliced (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce for sprinkling, if desired (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add chicken wings; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in fish sauce, cover, and cook another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pot. Stir in sweet rice and bring mixture to a boil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Portion soup into bowls and garnish with green onion. Serve with lemon slices and additional fish sauce, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
